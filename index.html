  <p>time to write a little bit about myself, somtimes I like to play video games mostly shooters but now I am getting back into minecraft. I have two sisters and one brother, the little girl in the picture is the youngest sister her name is kimberly shes only 2 years old and very sassy. anyway I hope to learn alot from this course because I have a passive interest in coding and cant wait to learn more about it. thanks for reading!!!  </p>
